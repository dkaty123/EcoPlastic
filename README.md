## Project Overview
EcoPlastic: This app started in summer of 2024, when I was creating a project for my position as 1 of 25 Marine Plastic Ambassadors across North Ameria. I wanted to reduce plastic pollution and also combine my tech skills!

EcoPlastic is a mobile application created to promote sustainable waste management practices, specifically focusing on recycling plastic. By utilizing machine learning, the app helps users identify and sort recyclable materials like plastic bottles, furniture, and paper directly from their smartphones. The more users recycle, the more rewards they earn, contributing to a cleaner environment. The app is built using Kotlin for Android, Firebase for the backend, and Google Cloud Maps API for location services. Won 1st Place ($3000) at the WUSA Change Engine Competition s

## Problem Statement
Plastic waste is a growing issue in many countries, including Canada, where improper disposal and overuse of plastic contribute to pollution in our local waterways and ecosystems. As a passionate advocate for environmental change, I have been working on this project to address these challenges. EcoPlastic: Recyclr provides a simple solution to educate people about proper recycling methods and incentivize them to take action through rewards, making recycling more accessible and enjoyable.

- Earn reward points for every item recycled, which can be redeemed for eco-friendly products and services.
- View nearby recycling collection points on a map.
- Learn how your recycled materials are processed and reused.

## App Architecture

The app follows a client-server architecture, where:

- **Frontend:** The frontend is developed using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** for a seamless and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend:** Firebase handles authentication, database management, and real-time data syncing for the app.

### Technologies Used:
- **Kotlin**: Primary language for Android app development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
- **Firebase**: Used for user authentication and real-time database.
- **Google Cloud Maps API**: Provides location tracking and nearby recycling points.
- **Android SDK**: The software development kit used for building Android applications.
- **Gradle**: Used for automating the build process.
- **GitHub**: Version control for managing the project codebase

## Screens

1. **Welcome Screen**: The app displays a welcome message and offers sign-in options (Google or email).
   
2. **Home Screen**: Displays a list of recyclable items (plastic bottles, furniture, paper) with images and descriptions. A "Scan Item" button allows users to scan objects.

3. **Collection Points Screen**: Displays a map of nearby recycling centers, allowing users to drop off their items. The map uses the Google Maps API.

## How to Run the App

1. **Install Android Studio**: Download Android Studio from [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).
